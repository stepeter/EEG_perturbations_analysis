# Source-localized EEG connectivity analysis during sensorimotor perturbations
Source localization and connectivity analysis of high-density EEG data, as used in our [published paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.05.038). The pre-processed, source-localized data we used for this analysis is available on [figshare](https://figshare.com/projects/Group-level_cortical_and_muscular_connectivity_during_perturbations_to_walking_and_standing_balance/62582). This dataset includes precomputed connectivity using direct directed transfer function (dDTF).

All code used EEGLAB (version 13.5.4b) run on Matlab 2013a. The EMD-CCA preprocessing requires [EMDLAB](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/plugins/EMDLAB_Plugin.zip), and connectivity analysis requires the [SIFT plugin](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/wiki/SIFT).
